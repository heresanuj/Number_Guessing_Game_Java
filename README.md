# Number Guessing Game (Java)

## 📌 Overview
The **Number Guessing Game** is a simple console-based Java application created to practice fundamental programming concepts such as **loops, conditional statements, arrays, and user input handling**.

This project is beginner-friendly and is intended for students who are starting with Java and building a foundation for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.

---

## 🎮 How the Game Works
- The program stores numbers from **1 to 10** in an array.
- The computer randomly selects one number from this array.
- The user is asked to guess the selected number.
- After each guess, the program provides hints:
  - **Too High** if the guess is greater than the selected number
  - **Too Low** if the guess is smaller than the selected number
- The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
- The total number of attempts is displayed at the end.

The program also validates user input and does not allow numbers outside the given range.

## ✨ Features
- Random number selection using `Random` class
- Input validation for numbers between 1 and 10
- Unlimited attempts until the correct guess
- Hint system (Too High / Too Low)
- Attempt counter

---

## 🛠 Concepts Used
- Arrays
- Loops (`while`)
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- `Scanner` class for user input
- `Random` class for random number generation
